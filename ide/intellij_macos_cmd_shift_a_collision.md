# Intellij on MacOS Cmd+Shift+A shortcut collision

IntelliJ's Actions shortcut default keys are Cmd+Shift+A, but on MacOS 
that same key pattern is the shortcut to open a terminal with the man 
search command.

To fix this we can diable the MacOS shortcut. We can also change the 
IntelliJ shortcut, but I'm already used to it and I don't use the MacOS 
shortcut anyway.

To disable the shortcut: 
- System settings
- Keyboard
- Keyboard Shortcuts...
- Services
- Text
- Disable "Search man Page Index in Terminal"
